```makefile
.PHONY: help config setup test optimize

 ASSISTANT_NAME = my-assistant

 help:
 	@echo "Assistant Setup Script"
 	@echo "=================="
 	@echo "make help - show this menu"
 	@echo "make setup - configure the assistant"
 	@echo "make test - test the assistant"
 	@echo "make optimize - optimize the assistant's performance"

 config:
 	@echo "Configuring $(ASSISTANT_NAME)..."
 	@# Add configuration steps here

 setup: config
 	@echo "Setting up $(ASSISTANT_NAME)..."
