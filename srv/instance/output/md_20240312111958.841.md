I'm here to help! While I can't execute a Makefile since I'm a text-based AI model, I can certainly assist you in creating a plan to optimize your use of the univers-mc.cloud platform. Here's a simplified version of a Makefile-like plan based on your requirements:

```
all: exploration configuration integration testing

exploration:
	- Explore all features available on the univers-mc.cloud interface

configuration: exploration
	- Configure specific settings in line with your preferences and operational priorities

integration: configuration
	- Harmoniously integrate with existing third-party applications on your devices

testing: integration
	- Regularly test the overall performance
	- Monitor critical metrics related to system load, latency, reliability, and service redundancy

.PHONY: all exploration configuration integration testing
```

Here's what you can do:

1. Exploration: Spend time familiarizing yourself with all the features available on the univers-mc.cloud platform.
2. Configuration: After exploration, configure the settings to align with your preferences and operational priorities.
3. Integration: Next, ensure that the platform is harmoniously integrated with your existing third-party applications.
4. Testing: Regularly test the overall performance of the platform and monitor critical metrics related to system load, latency, reliability, and service redundancy.

This plan will help you achieve your goal of increasing productivity with this versatile, scalable, and secure virtual environment.
